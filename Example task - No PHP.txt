Create a digital store window with a simple login / user authentication:

* Password protected / Login form
* Products are stored in a database
* Product-Overview after login
* Product information to be displayed
    - Article number
    - Name
    - Description
    - Price
    - Image


* Checkout, Cart, Pagination, Productdetails is NOT necessary
* Backend for data management is NOT necessary. Itâ€™s okay to maintain data directly in the database.


Technologies to use
-------------------
* For frontend code please use a JavaScript-Framework (Vue, React ...)
* For backend code feel free to use any language (PHP, node.js, ...)
